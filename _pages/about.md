I am a PhD candidate at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. I received my B.A. (2016) and B.E. (2017) in Engineering and French from Dartmouth College. For four years I worked as an embedded software engineer at Sarcos Robotics in Salt Lake City, UT. I received my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from UCSD in 2023 and expect to graduate with my PhD in Oceanography in May 2026. 

My research combines computational science and oceanography. As an example, I use optimization methods to solve inverse problems in ocean models. Most recently I have been working on a regional assimilation of the Equatorial Pacific Ocean where we work to improve representation of the Pacific Cold Tongue. I am also a software developer on an automatically-differentiable atmospheric model called the JAX Circulation Model (JCM). I am motivated by the impact of the projects I am involved in as well as the great people I get to work with! I also participate in the group for Chaos, Computation, Analysis and Optimization at SIO ([CaCAO](https://cacao.ucsd.edu/#group)).

I had a lot of fun creating and running the [SIO Software Workshop for Earth Science](https://eldavenport.github.io/SIO-PythonEarthScience/) and am a certified instructor for the [Software Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/index.html) organization. I am also enthusiastic about being a science tour guide for the [Scripps Community Outreach for Publich Education (SCOPE)](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/scope) program. Finally, I am passionate about science communication, open-source software, and female empowerment in engineering and ocean sciences.

In my free time I like to ski, surf, whitewater kayak, bike, climb and play the violin.
