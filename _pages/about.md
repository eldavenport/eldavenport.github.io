I am a Scripps PhD candidate working with Matt Mazloff at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. I received my B.A. (2016) and B.E. (2017) in Engineering and French from Dartmouth College. From 2017-2021 I worked as an embedded software engineer at Sarcos Robotics in Salt Lake City, UT before enrolling in graduate school at the UCSD Jacobs School of Engineering and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. I received my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from UCSD in 2023. 

My research focuses on estimation and optimization for oceanographic applications. I am most interested in data assimilation and optimization tools for climate/ocean model development and forecasting. I am enthusiastic about being a science tour guide for the [Scripps Community Outreach for Publich Education (SCOPE)](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/scope) program and a certified instructor for the [Software Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/index.html) organization. I am motivated by the impact of the projects I am involved in as well as by the teams of fun people I get to work with! I am passionate about science communication, teaching/mentorship, and female empowerment in engineering and ocean sciences.

In my free time I like to surf, whitewater kayak, bike, climb and play the violin.
