I am a PhD candidate at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (advisor Matt Mazloff). I received my B.A. (2016) and B.E. (2017) in Engineering and French from Dartmouth College. From 2017-2021 I worked as an embedded software engineer at Sarcos Robotics in Salt Lake City, UT. I received my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from UCSD in 2023. 

My research combines computational science and oceanography. On the computational side, I use optimization methods to solve inverse problems in ocean models. The region I have been most interested in is the Equatorial Pacific Ocean where we use data assimilation to study and improve representation of the dynamics of the Pacific Cold Tongue. I am also a software developer on an automatically-differentiable atmospheric model called the JAX Circulation Model (JCM). I am motivated by the impact of the projects I am involved in as well as the fun people I get to work with!

I had a lot of fun creating and running the [SIO Software Workshop for Earth Science](https://eldavenport.github.io/SIO-PythonEarthScience/) and am a certified instructor for the [Software Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/index.html) organization. I am also _very_ enthusiastic about being a science tour guide for the [Scripps Community Outreach for Publich Education (SCOPE)](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/scope) program. I am passionate about science communication, teaching/mentorship, and female empowerment in engineering and ocean sciences.

In my free time I like to ski, surf, whitewater kayak, bike, climb and play the violin.
