title: "Mechanisms of Zonal Momentum Transport at 0N, 140W in an Ocean State Estimate"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/JPO_2025_paper
excerpt: 'This paper is in review at the Journal of Physical Oceanography. We use a data-assimilating regional ocean model to diagnose the zonal momentum budget in the Pacific Cold Tongue and to evaluate the representation of vertical mixing by a subgrid-scale paramterization.'
